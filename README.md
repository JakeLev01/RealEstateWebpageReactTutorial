# RealEstateWebpageReactTutorial
Site is deployed at this address: https://real-estate-react-tutorial.pages.dev
This project was an introduction to React.js for me as I learned different libraries, responsiveness on various platfroms and how to deploy my project.
The site does not have a backend implemented, so most of the site is empty and the attributes have been made up by me.
I hope to add a backend to this project to make this a full-stack project!
